# An Idiographic Approach to Research on Cues to Deception

Contributors: Erik Mac Giolla, Timothy J. Luke

This repository contains supplemental material for a paper proposing an
idiographic research agenda for the study of cues to deception. The R scripts
stored here can be used to reproduce analyses and data visualizations based on
existing data from previous studies. Where possible, the scripts are designed to
automatically download the relevant data. However, in one case, the user will
need to manually download the data from the original source, since reuse of the
data requires agreement to terms and conditions.
